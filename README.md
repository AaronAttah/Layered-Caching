# Layered Caching with Nodejs-v1

In Node.js, a caching layer is the part of the backend application that contains the logic to implement response caching logic. This code must rely on a caching provider, such as Redis. Now, the problem is that Redis works in memory, and RAM is expensive.



This repository contains two branches:
- `master`: Basic implementation of the Redis-based Node.js caching layer.
- `compression`: Caching layer with compression/decompression option to save memory.
